      <h2>For kids</h2>
      <p>
        Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down
        to our museum, thereâ€™s plenty to see and do. You can learn about
        Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time
        and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth?

      <h2>For teachers</h2>
      <p>
        As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
        places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
        students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
        laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and
        inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more about
        our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through for
        a visit.
